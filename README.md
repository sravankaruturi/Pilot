# Pilot Game Engine

An OpenGL Game Engine.

This started as a supposedly RTS Game and then along the way, I introduced many features that I deemed were useful and helped me along the process.

It uses GLM Math Library.
It uses Dear Imgui for all the UI Elements.

# Features:

1. Able to Save your Current working Scene to a binary file and resume working later.
2. Can split your view into 4 viewports and assign different cameras for each viewport.
3. Select and Move Entities, multiple at a time, using mouse clicks.
4. Dynamically add more entities.
